# Bookworm

Bookworm is a small web app built as an exercise.

It reads large amounts of texts and tells what words were used and how many times. 

Bookworm is built with:
- AWS infrastructure
- ASP.NET Core with Razor Pages on the back-end
- HTML, CSS and simple JavaScript on the front-end
- CircleCI for CI/CD automation
