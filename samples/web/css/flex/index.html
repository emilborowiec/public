        On to flex displays. Let's say we have such boxes of content that we want to distribute in some way:
        <div class="bordered square">
          Box 1.
        </div>
        <span class="bordered">
          Box 2. This one is inline and autosized to the content.
        </span>
        <div class="bordered rect">
          Box 3
        </div>
        
        Let's see what happens if we put them all in one row on a too small of a container.
        <div class="flex-row-nowrap bordered bigbox">
            <div class="bordered square">
                Box 1.
              </div>
              <span class="bordered">
                Box 2. This one is inline and autosized to the content.
              </span>
              <div class="bordered rect">
                Box 3
              </div>      
        </div>
        Interesting. All the boxes were shrinked a bit to fit the content. Not sure why span takes the whole vertical space though. 
        I wonder if it will allow second row of content. Let's see.
        <div class="flex-row-wrap bordered bigbox">
            <div class="bordered square">
                Box 1.
              </div>
              <span class="bordered">
                Box 2. This one is inline and autosized to the content.
              </span>
              <div class="bordered rect">
                Box 3
              </div>      
        </div>
        Ok. So as it appears the span takes height up to the next row. I guess it depends on the alignment of items. Right 'stretch' is default. Let's play around with it.
        <div class="flex-row-wrap-baseline bordered bigbox">
            <div class="bordered square">
                Box 1.
              </div>
              <span class="bordered">
                Box 2. This one is inline and autosized to the content.
              </span>
              <div class="bordered rect">
                Box 3
              </div>      
        </div>
        Now let's try to get those items to go from top to bottom on the right side of the container.
        <div class="flex-column-right bordered bigbox">
            <div class="bordered square">
                Box 1.
              </div>
              <span class="bordered">
                Box 2. This one is inline and autosized to the content.
              </span>
              <div class="bordered rect">
                Box 3
              </div>      
        </div>
    </p>
  </body>
