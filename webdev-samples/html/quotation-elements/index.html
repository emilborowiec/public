    <p>I didn't know html5 had so many elements for quotations and citations. Let's check them out.</p>
    <p>Here's a short quote of someone who said something: <q>Yep. I said it!</q></p>
    <p>
        And here's a block quote of someone who said a lot of things
        <blockquote cite="http://www.emilborowiec.com">
            Last two weeks didnâ€™t give me much time for hobby programming.
            The citation is not rendred but is used by search engines. 
        </blockquote>

        Now let's try abbreviation <abbr title="You Ain't Gonna Need It">YAGNI</abbr>. Awesome.
    </p>
    <p>
        Address. I really think I ain't gonna need it.
        <address>
            John Snow<br>
            Winterfell<br>
            WESTEROS<br>
        </address>
        Interesting.
    </p>
    <p>The titles of whatever can be put inside cite element like this. The show <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> ended pretty badly.</p>
    <p>And now something completely different. <bdo dir="rtl">This text goes right to left. Imagine the possibilities!!</bdo></p>
